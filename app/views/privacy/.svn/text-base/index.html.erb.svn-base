                                 <p>DS SolidWorks conducts many different marketing activities by which it may   collect your personal information. For example, we collect contact information   at trade shows, we rent email and physical mail addresses for marketing   campaigns, we invite the public to download free software from our website in   return for providing us contact information, we run contests for which   participants provide basic information on registration, and we obtain addresses   from publications that target the industries from which we hope to attract   customers. When we rent lists of names and addresses, we rent them from entities   that provide only names of individuals who have &quot;opted in&quot; to receive   communications from companies such as DS SolidWorks and we typically do not   receive the actual contact information but only the ability to send an email or   mail to the contact from a bonded mailhouse.</p>

                                 <p>At the time customers register or activate their license of SolidWorks®   software, DS SolidWorks collects information such as Company name, shipping   address, contact name, contact email address, telephone number, title, role,   products designed, primary CAD product in use and industry sector. DS SolidWorks   requests this information because it believes it is important to understand who   its customers are and how to contact them with relevant product information. In   some circumstances, DS SolidWorks may be obligated to make this information   available to third parties who license to DS SolidWorks technology that is   included in the products being activated. If DS SolidWorks receives an inquiry   from a person at the licensee company as to which individual at the company has   activated a given license, DS SolidWorks will supply the contact name in   response to enable the company to understand where its licenses are being   used.</p>

                                 <p>DS SolidWorks may use the personal information you provide us for a variety   of purposes, including registration, authentication, and marketing. We may use   the information to inform you of special offers, contests, upgrades, and other   SolidWorks® software products and services that may be of interest to you. When   you are a customer of SolidWorks products or services, we may use your personal   information to contact you for a wide array of customer relation/customer   service purposes, such as to inquire whether you intend to renew subscription   service agreements or other contracts with DS SolidWorks or to request that you   respond to a survey concerning our products and services or to address a   question regarding an order. <br />
                                     <br />
                                   Since SolidWorks resellers are our primary   sales channel and provide the first line of support to our customers, we share   personal contact information with the reseller assigned to a particular customer   or prospect. <br />
                                   <br />
                                   We may also provide you with materials concerning the   products and/or services of other third parties we think may be of interest to   you. We may do this by emailing information to you or providing your name and   address to a bonded mailhouse that mails information on behalf of a third party.   The bonded mailhouse is prohibited from providing the third party with your name   and contact information and is obligated to either return the information to us   or destroy the list following the mailing. Unless we inform you otherwise at the   point at which we collect your information, we will not provide your personal   contact information directly to a third party not otherwise described herein. <br />
                                   <br />
                                   SolidWorks products (other than Cosmic Blobs, which is subject to a   separate privacy policy) are not marketed to children under the age of 13 and DS   SolidWorks does not knowingly collect personal information from children under   the age of 13. DS SolidWorks is committed to protecting the privacy of children   and if DS SolidWorks becomes aware that such information was collected, it will   treat that information as sensitive. <br />

                                   If you do not wish to receive   information about additional SolidWorks products or services or those of its   partners and other companies, please let us know (contact information below) and   we will respect your wishes. Emails we distribute describing offers we think may   be of interest to you also contain instructions as to how you can opt-out of   future emails. <br />

                                   DS SolidWorks stores the personal data of web site   visitors and customers indefinitely and may maintain and process such   information directly or indirectly in one or more databases in the United States   and elsewhere. We may hire other companies to provide services on our behalf   that may involve the storage and use of your personal information, such as for   delivering mailings or emails. Any such company or third party is required to   maintain the confidentiality of that information and is prohibited from using   that information for any purpose other than as authorized by us. If you provide   personal information to DS SolidWorks, you agree and consent to the storage and   usage of this information anywhere that DS SolidWorks and its affiliates   maintain offices (around the world), for a variety of purposes, including those   described above. <br />

                                   DS SolidWorks may also disclose such personal   information if required by law or if DS SolidWorks believes in good faith that   such disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process (for   example, a warrant or subpoena or other court order) or protect the rights,   property or personal safety of SolidWorks, our customers or the   public.</p>

From this site,   public users can find 3D models of products distributed by the manufacturers   identified therein. 3D ContentCentral has its own privacy policy, see <a href="http://www.3dcontentcentral.com/" target="_dcontentcentral">www.3dcontentcentral.com/</a> for the complete policy.   In general, a user must register at the 3D ContentCentral site or at another   site that is &quot;Powered by 3D PartStream.NET&quot; in order to view the models. DS   SolidWorks may pass the information it collects upon registration, which may   include personal information, to the manufacturers whose models the user   accesses and/or downloads. This requirement to share information regarding the   users who access the various manufacturer?s models is often a requirement of the   agreement under which those manufacturers make their models available to 3D   ContentCentral and/or 3D PartStream.NET. From time to time DS SolidWorks may   create other services requiring registration that may operate under similar   policies.</p>

Collection and processing of information related to   this purchase activity may be conducted by a third party fulfillment house that   is obligated to maintain the confidentiality of the information. We work to   protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure   Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.

                                 <p>Generally, DS SolidWorks? technical support group can obtain customer contact   information via the serial number and registration data it maintains in its   customer database. DS SolidWorks may use this contact information to respond to   support inquiries and/or to request additional information from the customer. <br />
                                     <br />
                                   Occasionally DS SolidWorks must obtain files and/or model information to   assist it in diagnosing their technical support issues. DS SolidWorks may share   model and file information provided by a customer with a licensor of technology   that is included in a SolidWorks product if DS SolidWorks considers that   appropriate to assist it in diagnosing or resolving a customer problem. All of   such licensors are also contractually obligated to protect the confidentiality   of customer models and files. <br />
                                   <br />
                                   Some third party software that   interoperates with the SolidWorks software, such as Microsoft?s Windows Vista®   operating system software, may request data from your system in order to assist   it in diagnosing issues. You will be informed of the need for this information   and may choose whether to provide it to the third party. The third party will be   responsible for any privacy issues related to the information you provide it. <br />

                                   DS SolidWorks also maintains many of the customer files in a database it   uses to conduct regression tests and other tests of later releases of the   SolidWorks software.</p>

                                       <U>DS SolidWorks? Remote Support   Functionality.</U></strong> </p>
                                 <p>For those customers with   difficult-to-diagnose issues, DS SolidWorks has added a remote support   functionality that enables DS SolidWorks to view a customer computer remotely   via the Internet in real-time. This functionality is used <U>only</U> when   authorized by the customer and while the customer is at the computer. The   functionality enhances the customer?s ability to explain and &quot;show&quot; the problem   being experienced. <br />
                                   <br />
                                   The customer initiates a secure connection with a   SolidWorks support engineer, enabling the support engineer to either view or   take control of the customer?s system. In order to create this connection, the   customer will download a small client (460KB) to his or her system that will   communicate with the support engineer?s computer. This connection will be   encrypted via a 168-bit secured socket layer to ensure that no data transmitted   between the customer system and the SolidWorks support engineer is compromised. <br />
                                   <br />
                                   The customer retains full control of his or her system throughout the   session. If at any time during this session the customer wishes to terminate the   remote connection, he or she may do so and upon termination the client will be   completely removed from the customer?s system, and the SolidWorks support   engineer will no longer be able to view or access the customer?s system. <br />
                                   <br />
                                   DS SolidWorks treats all information it receives during a remote support   session as confidential and proprietary customer information received for   technical support purposes (see <strong>Information Collected in Connection with   Technical Support and the Use of That Information</strong> above).</p>

                                 Performance Feedback Email Tool.</U></strong> </p>
                                 <p>The   SolidWorks products include a feedback tool that, if turned on, sends   reliability and usage information to DS SolidWorks via email or HTTP. The   feedback tool is turned off unless turned on by the user and it may be turned   off and on repeatedly at the option of the user. This data is used only for   quality and product improvement purposes and helps give DS SolidWorks an idea of   the relative value of various functionalities within its products. The data does   not include any user model data or any information that could be used to   re-create models, and is reviewed by DS SolidWorks in the aggregate. </p>
